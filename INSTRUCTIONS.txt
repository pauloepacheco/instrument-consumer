Notes
--------------
#1 HSQL database is used in order to have the INSTRUMENT_PRICE_MODIFIER table.
#2 Guava cache is used to get the multiplier value from INSTRUMENT_PRICE_MODIFIER table for a given instrument name. This value is cached for 5 seconds.
#3 This solution does not load the entire file in memory. Each line of the file is processed and then discarded without keeping it in memory.
#4 YourKit-Java-Profiler has been used to determine the consume of memory and CPU for this solution.
#5 I have created a huge file of 32GB and this solution was able to process and compute the data without any issue.
